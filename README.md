# Unofficial Apex Legends Bug Tracker 🐞

## Disclaimer ⚖

This place is not related to or associated with EA or Respawn. This is purely a community driven project - by users, for users.

## Why this exists 💡

Apex Legends has so many bugs that not even the devs can remember all of them. Since Apex is turning more and more decrepit with every single update, there needs to be a central place to track the issues. In the past, Respawn have had a trello board, but that's nothing more than a publicity stunt. It didn't list anywhere near all the bugs, and it was never updated. There was no way to track progress and discuss the issues or figure out possible work arounds.

## Why do Respawn's job for them? 🤔

Several people have asked something similar to the following question:

> personally i wouldn't participate in this because why do free work for EA?

To control the narrative. It is convenient for Respawn not to have a list like this, which is exactly why we're having a list like this. If no one knows about long standing issues in Apex, there is no pressure on Respawn to finally fix them. Eventually hopefully EA's shareholders are going to start asking why EA and Respawn are killing the gold egg laying goose, and EA will get a fire lit under their asses to start caring about quality assurance and bug fixing instead of just caring about "line go up" 📈.

## The bugs! 🐛

## How to report a bug 🌱

1. ⏩ Go to the "Issues" link at the top of this page, or simply follow this link: https://github.com/apex-legends-bugs/bugs/issues
2. 👀 Look through the open issues. See if your desired issue already exists. And I really mean LOOK, actually spend time searching.
3. If a report about your issue already exists, open the it and see if there is any relevant info that you could add that hasn't been discussed yet. This means ONLY information that could help solving the bug or finding the workaround.
4. ❌ DO NOT POST THINGS SUCH AS:
  - "Hey is this fixed yet?"
  - "Bump"
  - "Encountered this too" (on an issue that has already been confirmed)
  - "This happened to Nicewigg one time"
  - "Thank you"
  - "Respawn greedy" / "EA Sucks"
  - Reports of completely unrelated issues. Start a new issue if you want to report a new issue.

  💀 If you post stuff like that, it will eventually kill the project because the effort to weed out stupid submissions is too much. Don't post replies like that! You will be immediately banned without an explanation given if you do stuff like that.

5. ✅ DO POST THINGS SUCH AS:
  - a clip of the issue (if a good clip doesn't exist yet, or if your clip shows something new about the issue)
  - confirmation that you experienced the issue (if the issue hasn't been confirmed yet)
6. 💥 IF YOU SEARCHED ALL THE BUGS AND FOUND NOTHING, you may post a new issue. Try to be as useful as possible: include a youtube clip and a screenshot of the issue happening. Include the exact time and date the issue happened. Include what your server was set to. Include your platform.
7. 🛡 To report an issue, you need to have a GitHub account. Sign up with it. This requirement exists to prevent people spamming the issue tracker. You can sign up at https://www.github.com
