# Unofficial Apex Legends Bug Tracker 🐞

## Disclaimer ⚖

This place is not related to or associated with EA or Respawn. This is purely a community driven project - by users, for users.

## Why this exists 💡

Apex Legends has so many bugs that not even the devs can remember all of them. Since Apex is turning more and more decrepit with every single update, there needs to be a central place to track the issues. In the past, Respawn have had a trello board, but that's nothing more than a publicity stunt. It didn't list anywhere near all the bugs, and it was never updated. There was no way to track progress and discuss the issues or figure out possible work arounds.

## How to support this project

Spread the news and let people know. Tell your favourite content creators, streamers, and pro players to use this and report bugs. We want to show a unified front to Respawn and EA who are simply neglecting the code base of Apex.
